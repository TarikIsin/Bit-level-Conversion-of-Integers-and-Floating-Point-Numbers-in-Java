# Bit-level-Conversion-of-Integers-and-Floating-Point-Numbers-in-Java


This project is about implementing an application that converts different types of numbers to hexadecimal format. The application takes a file with signed, unsigned and floating point numbers, the byte ordering type and the size of the floating point data type as input. The application uses 2's complement, unsigned integer and IEEE-like representations for the conversion. The application also rounds the fraction bits of the floating point numbers using the round to nearest even method.
